    <h2>Why the LIS Program?</h2>
    <p>
      I am pursuing the LIS program to strengthen my understanding of how libraries use
      technology to support access, equity, and community engagement. I am especially
      interested in digital services, web platforms, and how online content expands the
      reach of public libraries.

The houses are clustered closely together along a narrow street, creating a charming and historic village atmosphere. The sky is clear and blue, adding to the serene and inviting feel of the scene."
