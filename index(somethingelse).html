      <h2>Why the LIS Program?</h2>
      <p>
        I am pursuing my LIS degree to deepen my understanding of how libraries use
        technology to support access, equity, and community engagement. I am especially
        interested in how digital tools and web platforms expand library services beyond
        physical spaces.

        After graduation, I hope to work in public libraries focusing on technology,
        digital services, and programming for teens and young adults.

        alt="A picturesque scene of traditional Trulli houses in Alberobello, Italy. These unique structures are built with whitewashed stone walls and feature conical, stone-tiled roofs. The houses are clustered closely together along a narrow street, creating a charming and historic village atmosphere. The sky is clear and blue, adding to the serene and inviting feel of the scene."
